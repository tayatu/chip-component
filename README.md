# Getting Started with Create React App


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Specification

When you click on the input field, a list of Users will appear.
As you type, the users list will show only items that match what you're typing.
Clicking on an item will turn it into a chip at the top, and the input field will adjust automatically.
Once an item becomes a chip, it should no longer be in the list.
Each chip has an "X" icon. Clicking it removes the chip and adds the item back to the list.
